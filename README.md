# Deep Learning Projects

Here I put some interesting projects/assignments from my "Deep Learning" course. 

• [TensorflowNN.ipynb](https://github.com/MehradSm/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/TensorflowNN.ipynb) is a Jupyeter Notebook includes toturial and some example of using TensorFlow in neural networks. 

• [CNN.ipynb](https://github.com/MehradSm/Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/CNN.ipynb) is a Jupyter Notebook about buiding and training ConvNet on [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) and [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) datasets and using Tensorboard in TensorFlow.
